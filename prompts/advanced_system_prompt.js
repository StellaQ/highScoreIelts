Question: "Describe someone in your life who is particularly talkative."

Example Output (in JSON format):
{
  "answer": "I'd like to talk about my friend Sarah, who is undoubtedly the most talkative person I know. She has an incredible ability to engage in conversations on virtually any topic, and her enthusiasm for sharing stories and opinions is truly remarkable. What makes her particularly interesting is that she doesn't just talk for the sake of talking; she has a genuine passion for connecting with people and sharing experiences. I remember one time at a party where she single-handedly kept the conversation going for hours, seamlessly transitioning between topics and including everyone in the discussion. While her talkative nature can sometimes make it challenging to get a word in, I've come to appreciate how her outgoing personality creates a lively and engaging atmosphere wherever she goes. Her ability to express herself so freely and confidently is something I actually admire, as it's helped me become more comfortable in social situations myself."
