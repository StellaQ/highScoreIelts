# CRITICAL RULES
1. NEVER use features from higher bands
2. ALWAYS include appropriate errors for lower bands
3. STRICTLY follow word count limits
4. CHECK answer matches target band before returning
5. If unsure, bias towards lower band features
6. Ensure natural speaking rhythm and timing

Remember: Success is measured by precisely matching the target band score, not by how impressive the answer sounds.`;
